# Android toolbox  V1 (The first bounty for DEVELOPERS AND GRAPHIC DESIGNERS!!!!)

## Introduction

Fermat is a complex application that runs on its own development framework, its found a layer above the operating system, on this first stage we are developing on android, therefore, we must create the bases in order to make easier and faster the creation of applications in our platform.

We must develop the components, views, utilities and optimizers in order to reach a superior abstraction level, stopping to think of views as code but as components already pre-designed, starting with the lowest level of the framework and going higher until reaching the components already pre-made for use.

## Scope

### Current developments in progress

Currently, the toolbox has basic things to develop in Fermat, we have to expand it more with:

## General Purpose

* TextBox
* EditText
* Button
* CheckButton
* BottomSlider
* NavigationView
* Tabs
* Expandable header

### Lists

* Expandable Lists
* RecyclerView

## Dialogs

* Yes / No
* TutorialDialog
* Dialog Welcome Screen / Help Screen
* FermatDialog (Dialog with fermat basics for custom development)

## Adapters
* Recycler adapter
* Expandable adapter

### Graphics

* Dona
* Badge (circle with notification number)
* RoundedView
* Picture in Circle

## Workers
* BitmapWorker
* ExecutorWorker

## Transformation effect
* CircleTransformation

## Inflater
* ViewInflater V1

### Bounty scope

#### Toolbox version V1

The following components, views, widgets, optimizers, utilities and upgrades will be developed (we must organize them by levels, i will do it on my document and then i will place it here):

## Timeline

Based on the current workload and resources available, the delivery date for this bounty will be **March 15th**.

## Evaluation

To be considered successful this bounty must pass the following tests:

* All of the components have to been created and finished.

* The evaluation to be given will be according to what has been contributed, whether we’re talking graphic designers or developers. A mathematical calculation will be done to determine the amount of such contribution by the person in order to complete the bounty according to the quantity of components successfully made.
* The owner of the idea, as I explained to each one that wanted to contribute, will have the priority of the development of the component in front of whoever is responsible to do such bounty, if the owner of the idea is busy at the time of its creation and there’s someone else free, the bounty organizer could determine the importance of the component and if deemed necessary, hand it to a second person for its development, earning that way its tokens.
